# Pitch

## Red line

-   Two months ago some people in our building moved out. They had the same floorplan and flat quality as our flat. But they paid twice the amount - instead of 1500, they paid 3000. This is not morally ok.
-   It is also illegal (MEME OF CRIMINAL)
-   That is why lawfirms are specializing on this
-   1. problem: germans don't talk about money -> so the don't know how much their neighbors pay
-   2. problem: These forms are quite hard to fill out, don't always say where they
-   The whole experience doesn't really invite people to become aware of their rights
-   Solution: Combine the data and statistics we have about the official rent limit + the average rent of others in a simple to use interface
-   Show off:

## Questions

Q: Why couldn't the landlord just kick people out.
A: First, in most cases they need a proper reason. Secondly, same as with Unions, when one worker strikes, he just gets fired. But when a union strikes, the company comes to a halt. "Gegenmacht von unten bauen - so to speak".
